# Search and Upload Image Project in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Search`

For the search we use Axios and hit an the search enpoint for unsplash.com. This free endpoint will always return 10 images.

### `Upload`

For the upload I kept it simple. Use Axios and try to hit an enpoint listening on localhost:8000. It will failed with a message "Could not upload the Image!"
